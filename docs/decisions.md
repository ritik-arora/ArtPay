											Architectural Decisions - Real-Time Art Auction Platform - ArtPay

 1. Architectural Style: Microservices
Decision:  
The platform is built using a microservices architecture where each core function (User, Auction, Bid, Payment, Notification) is an independent service.

Reasoning:  
- Independent scalability of services
- Technology stack flexibility
- Easier deployment and fault isolation

Trade-offs:  
- Increased operational complexity
- Requires service discovery and inter-service communication management

---

 2. Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka)
Decision:  
Used Apache Kafka as the message broker for events such as `bid_placed` and `auction_closed`.

Reasoning:  
- Decouples services
- Enables asynchronous processing
- Supports high throughput for real-time systems

Trade-offs:  
- Eventual consistency instead of strict ACID
- Requires handling duplicate messages (idempotency)

---

 3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Decision:  
Separated read and write models for auction data.  
- Writes go to PostgreSQL
- Reads (leaderboards) served from Redis

Reasoning:  
- Optimizes performance for high-read workloads
- Allows independent scaling of query layer

Trade-offs:  
- Increased code complexity
- Potential for stale reads if sync is delayed

---

 4. API Gateway Pattern
Decision:  
Single entry point for all client requests via API Gateway (Nginx/Express Gateway).

Reasoning:  
- Centralized authentication and rate limiting
- Simplifies client communication
- Hides internal service topology

Trade-offs:  
- Gateway can be a bottleneck if not scaled properly
- Adds extra hop latency

---

 5. Caching Layer (Redis)
Decision:  
Use Redis for storing and retrieving top bids in real-time.

Reasoning:  
- Sub-millisecond access time for leaderboards
- Reduces load on primary database

Trade-offs:  
- Requires cache invalidation strategy
- Possible cache inconsistency

---

 6. Data Stores
PostgreSQL  
- Used for transactional operations (user accounts, auctions, bids)  
- Strong ACID guarantees

MongoDB  
- Used for storing historical auction data and analytics  
- Flexible schema for varied auction data

Trade-offs:  
- Two database systems mean higher operational complexity

---

 7. Fault Tolerance Patterns
Circuit Breaker Pattern  
- Implemented in Payment Service calls to avoid cascading failures.

Trade-offs:  
- Might reject legitimate requests if thresholds are too aggressive

---

 8. Observability
Decision:  
Use Prometheus for metrics and Grafana for visualization.

Reasoning:  
- Enables proactive monitoring
- Helps in capacity planning and incident response

Trade-offs:  
- Requires maintaining monitoring stack

---

 9. Deployment Strategy
Decision:  
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration (future step)

Reasoning:  
- Simplifies scaling and deployment
- Cloud-agnostic

Trade-offs:
- Kubernetes has a steep learning curve

---

10. Security
Decision: 
- JWT for authentication
- Role-based access control

Reasoning: 
- Stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems
- Clear separation of permissions

Trade-offs:
- Requires secure key management
